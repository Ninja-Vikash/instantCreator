### How to use it

1. Create a folder for your project.
2. Create `main.js`.
3. Initialize npm in your directory using:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```
> [!NOTE]\
> Use `npm init -y` to skip configuration prompts during initialization.

4. Paste the following code into your `main.js` file:

    ```js
    const fs = require("fs");

    /**
     *  Code for creating html document
    */
    const instantCreator = (projectName) => {
      const indexHTML = `<!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html lang="en"> 
    <head> 
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
        <title>${projectName}</title> 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> 
    </head> 
    <body> 
        <!-- Write your code here --> 
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    `;
      fs.writeFile("index.html", indexHTML, () => {
        console.log("\u2713 FILE : HTML file has been created!");
      });
    };

    /**
     *  Code for creating css document
    */
    const styleCSS = `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@200;400;500;700;900&display=swap'); 

    * { 
      margin: 0; 
      padding: 0; 
      box-sizing: border-box; 
      font-family: 'Poppins';
    } 

    body, 
    html { 
      height: 100%; 
      width: 100%;
    }
    `;

    setTimeout(() => {
      fs.writeFile("style.css", styleCSS, () => {
        console.log("\u2713 FILE : CSS file has been created!");
      });
    }, 0);

    /**
     *  Code for creating js document
    */
    const scriptJS = `console.log("Hello World")`;

    setTimeout(() => {
      fs.writeFile("script.js", scriptJS, () => {
        console.log("\u2713 FILE : Javascript file has been created!");
      });
    }, 0);

    instantCreator("document"); // Pass here the name of your webpage you want to show.

    /**
     *  Confirmation
    */
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("\u2713 DONE : instantCreator deployment!");
    }, 500);
    ```
> [!NOTE]\
> Code for InstantCreator. Customize the webpage title by passing the desired name to `instantCreator("mywebpage")`.
